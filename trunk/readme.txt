== Description ==

Having used disable items in the past, it made sense to put everything in one place, so its a single plugin with a few options instead of 4 plugins.

Planned features if there is enough support/usage for the plugin: Offload Google fonts and Fontawesome to our MaxCDN account or re-writing rules to
load Google and MaxCDN from your (our?) own CDN.

<b>Emojis</b><br>
Disabling Emojis does not disable emoticons, it disables the support for Emojis added since WP 4.2, it also gets rid of 1 HTTP request helping speed up your site.

<b>Embeds</b><br>
Disabling Embeds This is a script that auto formats pasted content in the visual editor, such as videos, tweets, etc. However, this is not really needed.
A big issue with this script is that it loads on every single page, whether it is being used or not. You can still use the default embed code from YouTube
and Twitter to included content, even when this script is disabled. And we get rid of another HTTP Request

<b>Remove Query Strings</b>
If you look at your source or a waterfall view of your page load, you will see your query strings end in something like ver=1.12.4 or vers=3.4.1. These are
called query strings and help determine the version of the script. The problem with query strings like these is that it isnâ€™t very efficient for caching
purposes and sometimes prevents caching those assets altogether.  If you are using a CDN already, you can ignore this OPTION_KEY

<b>Gravatars</b><br>
Disabling Gravatars is completely optional, advise, if you dont use them, disable as it gets rid of one more useless HTTP request.

<b>General Performance improvements</b>
